Institution : LIP, Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon
Date : April 2001
Description :  This library offers inductive definitions of basics
in graph theory. The goal is to offer the possibility to write proofs
and programs on graphs in the same formalism : the Coq language.
It now contains : vertices, arcs, edges, degrees, graphs, directed
graphs,
paths, acyclic graphs, connected graphs and tree.
Keywords : graph theory, Curry-Howard's isomorphism, inductive
definitions
